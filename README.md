# Python-Antivirus
An antivirus in python.

11 Anti-Virus engines wrongfully detect my Anti-Virus as a virus. https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/d3c5a433f66c6dd86c24fccaf0b994fdd7ef5b191f76b920f435b521182360ea/detection

That must mean they see me as a competitor :-D

Well its kinda 9 anti-viruses, becouse 2 anti-viruses classified it as riskware. Definition:
Riskware is the name given to **legitimate** programs that can cause damage if they are exploited by malicious users â€“ in order to delete, block, modify or copy data, and disrupt the performance of computers or networks .
